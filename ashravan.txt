Ashravan's eyes flickered open, a torrent of numbness washing over him before the familiar landscapes of reality came into focus. The restoration Shai had performed was nothing short of a miracle — every thread of his being meticulously woven back to life. Yet, as life returned, so did the whispers of promises unkept and debts unpaid.

The city around him hummed with the bustle of a world unaware of the miracle in their midst. Ashravan knew that his existence now hinged on one fragile detail — the secret he harbored within the core of his restored memories. Knowledge that could topple empires, or birth them anew.

Drawn to the labyrinthine undercity, Ashravan sought the refuge of old allies, those who once stood at his side before time tried to erase him from the annals. But shadows follow the light, and enemies wove an insidious net tighter with each step he took.

A sudden ambush left him breathless and bleeding, the cold steel pressing against his throat a cruel reminder of mortality. Yet, in those final moments, he smiled — for Shai had not only restored his body but gifted him with a purpose anew. The key to the city's salvation, or its undoing, lay within his grasp.

With a last surge of strength, Ashravan shattered his bonds, disappearing into the night on the cusp of dawn. The restored man was no longer the same; he was a beacon of hope, a harbinger of change, entangled in a destiny he was now ready to claim.
